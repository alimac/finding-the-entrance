Note:
- Came 40 miles short: Staunton, IL
- Northeast and across the state border
- Home of Tour de Donut



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/tour-de-donut.jpg" data-background-size="1068px" -->

Note:
- 32 mile bike race
- 2 donut stops along the way
- For each donut eaten, 5 minutes taken off your ride time
- Personal record: 2 donuts

<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/xkcd-online-communities-map.png" data-background-size="680px" data-state="show-header" data-header="Source: xkcd.com/802/" -->

Note:
- "Map of Online Communities" by Randall Munroe of XKCD
- Slightly out of date (circa 2010)
- Drupal and community have been around longer
- ... where is it?



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/xkcd-fragment-1-annotated.png" data-background-size="1280px" data-state="show-header" data-header="Source: xkcd.com/802/" -->

Note:
- Drupal community uses IRC for online chat
- First search location: IRC Isles
- No luck, and too close to Troll Bay



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/xkcd-fragment-2-annotated.png" data-background-size="1280px" data-state="show-header" data-header="Source: xkcd.com/802/" -->

Note:
- Bay of Drama? Buzzword Bay?
- Adrift in the Sea of Opinions



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/isle-of-drupal.jpg" data-background-size="1280px" -->
## Isle of Drupal
<!-- .element: class="hidden" -->

Note:
- Found: Isle of Drupal
- Landmarks, but no detail
- Maps are static, need another approach



## How is Drupal made?
<img src="custom/images/drupal-releases.png" class="fragment">

Note:
- Maybe we can get a better picture of how community looks like, how it works by looking at how the project is built?
- Ever wonder what goes into these files?



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/christoph-spiegl-code.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo: CC-BY-NC Christoph Spiegl http://flic.kr/p/7DmgDW, cropped" -->
## Code
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Download Drupal, unpack and open up in a text editor
- Different kinds of code: PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript
- How did that code get there?
- How do we change the code, and make Drupal even better?



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/amanda-sewing-patches.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo: CC-BY-NC-ND amanda https://flic.kr/p/7NSvF, cropped" -->
## Patch
<!-- .element: class="heading invert" -->

Note:
- First let's think about what changes to code are: adding code, removing code
- Changes are grouped together in a set.
- Set of changes is packaged into a file ("patch")



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/amanda-sewing-patches.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo: CC-BY-NC-ND amanda https://flic.kr/p/7NSvF, cropped" -->
<img src="custom/images/patch.png" alt="Contents of a patch file">
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

Note:
- A patch is a plain text file
- Lines added are marked with +, lines removed are marked with -
- Patch is applied to the project codebase, transforming it
- Where do patches come from?



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/wlodi-big-red-button.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo: CC-BY-SA włodi https://flic.kr/p/5GCeGg, cropped" -->
## Starting point
<!-- .element: class="heading invert" -->

Note:
- Someone makes a feature request or reports a bug
- Create a new issue on drupal.org



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/wlodi-big-red-button.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo: CC-BY-SA włodi https://flic.kr/p/5GCeGg, cropped" -->
> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
> I mashed the button, but it didn't do anything.
> <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

Note:
- Not a great description of the problem, but it's a start
- And maybe...



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/wlodi-big-red-button.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo: CC-BY-SA włodi https://flic.kr/p/5GCeGg, cropped" -->
> <!-- .element: class="invert" -->
> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
> Me too!
> <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>
> <i class="fa fa-heart fragment current-visible" style="color: #c00;"></i>

Note:
- Someone comes along and adds a "Me too!" comment
- Meetoos are great. Meetoos validate our pain.
- What next?



## Issue summary
<img src="custom/images/issue-summary.png" alt="Screenshot of drupal.org example issue summary" class="fragment">

Note:
- Original post serves as "issue summary"
- Anyone can add words to the issue summary
- Steps to reproduce, screenshots or screencasts
- Finally...



## A patch appears!

Note:
- Someone writes the first set of changes to the Drupal codebase that fix the problem
- Maybe patch is incomplete
- Maybe automated tests fail
- But...



## Second patch

Note:
- Someone else can build on the work done in the first patch
- Process can be repeated, until the patch is ready to be reviewed



## Review

Note:
- Reviewing is important to the process of making Drupal better
- Does the patch fix the problem?
- Post before and after screenshots
- Check coding standards



## Reviewed and tested by community

Note:
- RTBC
- Drupal core committers review issues that reach RTBC status
- They check the changes and commit, if everything looks OK
- Issue creator, screenshot creator, patch contributors, reviewers all get commit mentions
- Watch this process happen live at 2014 DrupalCamp NYC

## Contributions
<!-- .element: class="heading invert" -->

Note:
- Creating an issue, adding information, posting patches and reviewing are all valuable contributions
- Invisible element: organizing the event
- Let's bring the focus to the *people* that make the Drupal community
- I asked a few people what they do in the community, why they do what they do, and how they got started.

Note:
- Co-organizer of Drupal Lima meetup: shares knowledge through workshops and talks
- Introduced by a friend to open source: ability to build sustainable career path
- Goal: increase women's participation in the tech community
- Visibility converts into reputation, which gives opportunities to grow career-wise and as a person
- Let's look at the Drupal island one more time



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/isle-of-drupal-sea-routes.jpg" data-background-size="1280px" -->
## Sea routes
<!-- .element: class="hidden" -->

Note:
- Movement: Drupal community is part of intersecting communities
- Communities around technologies like PHP
- Topics: accessibility, multilingual, user experience, automation
- Let's take a look at the many ways you can get involved



## 19
<!-- .element: class="heading" style="font-size: 6em;" -->

Note:
- 19 ways to "enter" the Drupal community
- Not in any particular order
- You might already be doing this stuff!



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Support
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Do you like figuring things out? Working out a solution within constraints?
- Support online: forums, chat. In person: at meetups, user groups
- Providing support makes you smarter and trains your empathy



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Usability testing
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Do you like to break things? Point out broken things?
- Find and document bugs. You don't have to fix them!
- Test and review patches: do they work?



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Documentation
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- "Documentation is worth its weight in code."
- All about adding and removing words, like code
- Goal: make things clear and easy to understand



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Translate
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Do you know a language that's not English?
- 100+ translations of Drupal
- Fully translated: Ukrainian, Swedish, Spanish
- (I'm still hoping someone will translate Drupal into Klingon)



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Contribute to Drupal core
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Remember all the contributions that are made on issues?
- Front-end or back-end: review code, write code
- Always document code: lack of documentation is a bug!



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Marketing
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Introduce and promote Drupal to people who haven't heard of it
- Tell someone about how Drupal helped you address your needs
- Boost the signal on social networks



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Core initiatives
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Interest areas that have strategic importance for the Drupal projects
- Configuration management, design, mobile, multi-lingual, web services
- Topics: accessibility, documentation, performance, testing, usability
- [MAINTAINERS.txt](http://cgit.drupalcode.org/drupal/tree/core/MAINTAINERS.txt)



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Attend events
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Check this one off the list: you are here and you are awesome
- Even if you can't attend in person, watch recorded talks
- Give feedback to presenters: "I really liked... I wish that..."



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Give talks
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Great way to learn about a topic
- 20 minute talk about Vagrant: spent many hours getting into the nuts and bolts of Vagrant
- "I'm just a beginner": as a beginner at something, you are already an *expert* at being a beginner



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Help organize events
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Putting on events like DrupalCamp St Louis is a tough but rewarding task
- All kinds of skillsets are needed to organize events
- Got spare time? Help organize DrupalCamp St. Louis next year



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Start a meetup
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Maybe there aren't any Drupal user groups in your area
- Start your own! It can be hyperlocal: meetup at your workplace, school
- Set up a regular time and place



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Write blog posts
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Similar to giving talks, except the audience is not looking right at you
- Describe a particularly frustrating experience and how you solved it
- Blog posts are your personal documentation



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Make screenscasts, podcasts
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Somewhere between giving a talk and writing a blog post
- There are many great podcasts to listen to while you are driving or on a train
- There is always room to make your own!



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Build a module or theme
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Contributed projects are mini-Drupal projects
- Important to sustain the core project
- Release your custom code to the community
- Get others to work on it, fund bugs and make improvements



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Donate
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->
[Drupal 8 Accelerate](https://assoc.drupal.org/d8accelerate)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- Drupal is free to use, it's open source
- Working on open source is not free. It costs time (not spent with family, or working to support oneself)
- Drupal 8 Accelerate fund supports work being done on Drupal 8
- Brings people together for critical sprints on important topics



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Join Drupal Association
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Drupal association provides community grants and organizes DrupalCons
- Europe, North America, South America, coming in 2016: Asia
- Membership start at $15



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Sponsor an event
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Meetups, camps, sprints all need sponsors
- Doesn't always have to be money: offer event space? Buy snacks, coffee and tea, lunch?
- Benefit: meet current and future developers, contributors, project managers, generalists, designers and learners



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Become a mentor
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Takes place online and in person
- Online mentoring every week on IRC chat
- In person mentoring at events



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
### Encourage others
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- A story from DrupalCon Los Angeles
- One of the most powerful things you can do is give encouragement to another person, and invite them to do something together



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/australian-afternoon.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="" -->
## My story
<!-- .element: class="heading invert" -->

Note:
- Went to DrupalCon Denver, Global Sprint Weekend, DrupalCon Portland
- Overwhelming, feeling of inadequacy about making a meaningful contribution
- Global Sprint Weekend 2014: asked about my goals ("what do you want to learn?"), autonomy in defining objectives was powerful
- key benefit: learned to ask questions
- what sustains me: being around *accessibly smart and kind people*




<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/nancy-nance-door.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo: CC-BY nancynance https://flic.kr/p/srX6Dn" -->
## Tomorrow
<!-- .element: class="hidden" -->
> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
> When you develop an interest, it usually comes from an environment that de-dramatizes things.
> Because then you’re able to <span class="highlight">find your own entrance</span> into it.

> <span><a href="http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/746-what-happens-when-there-are-no-boys-in-the-room-a-report-from-robyns-tekla-conference/">Robyn</a></span>
<!-- .element: class="quote-source" -->

Note:
- Sprint tomorrow: people of all skills welcome
- Write down top three things about Drupal (or related technologies) that you are interested in, right now.
- Pick a thing on the list. Maybe break it down into smaller parts, if needed
- Learn it! And ask questions
