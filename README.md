## How is Drupal made?
<img src="custom/images/drupal-releases.png" class="fragment">

Note:
- Maybe we can find out how community works by looking at how the project is built?
- Ever wonder what goes into these files?



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/christoph-spiegl-code.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo: CC-BY-NC Christoph Spiegl http://flic.kr/p/7DmgDW, cropped" -->
## Code
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Download Drupal, unpack and open up in a text editor
- Different kinds of code: PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript
- How did that code get there?
- How do we change the code, and make Drupal event better?



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/amanda-sewing-patches.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo: CC-BY-NC-ND amanda https://flic.kr/p/7NSvF, cropped" -->
## Patch
<!-- .element: class="heading invert" -->

Note:
- Changes to code: adding code, removing code

<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

Note:
- A patch is a plain text file
- Lines added are marked with +, lines removed are marked with -
